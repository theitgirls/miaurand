        <h2>&hearts; Butterflies and Machine Learning: How Do They Correlate? &hearts;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Butterflies and machine learning. Can they coexist together?
            Actually, yes they can. Today, me and my partner Mary Rickman
            answered that question as we used the source Teachable Machine
            to answer one simple question: can an AI machine tell different types
            of butterflies from each other? 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of Teachable Machine, we set up a simple test. we
            uploaded 17 pictures each for three types of butterflies: the
            monarch, the sonoran, and the purple hairstreak. Then, we told
            Teachable Machine to train the model. It took a couple of seconds
            for it to train, but it worked! We now had a model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, it was time to test our model out. We had collected a bunch
            of sample images to try it out. We had one of each butterfly, then 
            a random butterfly image to see what would happen. The model worked
            well at identifying the first three images; the only problem was the 
            little hints of colors on the butterflies. But the random butterfly 
            was a mix of all three. It couldn't be classified due to its nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, I think the AI would be able to work better with more
            data. Mary and I wished we had more time to work on this. I think that
            AI has more practical uses as well, like for helping computers find specific
            organs in the body, or teaching emotions to people with neural problems. I hope
            that we can work more on this, and maybe this will spiral into a butterfly
            identifying application someday!

        <h2>Using Code in A Specific Department: How Does It Apply?</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today at IT Girls, our supervisor Laurie Ferger gave us a
            challenge: we were going to hold a scavenger hunt across campus
            to see how different departments used technology. Me, Gia, and
            Kate went across campus, interviewing a bunch of different people.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the people we interviewed was iSchool Career Services worker
            Jeff Fouts. He was one of the last people we interviewed on our hunt,
            and he was quite friendly during the talk. His job? To help students
            find interships and careers around campus and the city. He gave us some
            insight into the iSchool scene. Did you know that there are more women at
            the iSchool, and that they make a greater salary at their jobs than men do?
        </p>
        <p>
            Fouts uses his online technology and data to help match students with
            an intership. The data also shows employers whether a student would meet
            the qualifications for the internship or not. Technology also helps the students
            get updated on the status of their intership, and if anything changes Throughout
            their intership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fouts has this advice to give to the IT Girls, as well as anyone who is 
            aspiring to go into the iSchool or computing in general: "Times are changing,
            it's a great time to enter the field. It's great to see how far ahead you
            girls are."
        </p>
        <p>Special thanks to Jeff Fouts for the interview.</p>
