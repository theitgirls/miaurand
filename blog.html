        <h2>&hearts; Butterflies and Machine Learning: How Do They Correlate? &hearts;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Butterflies and machine learning. Can they coexist together?
            Actually, yes they can. Today, me and my partner Mary Rickman
            answered that question as we used the source Teachable Machine
            to answer one simple question: can an AI machine tell different types
            of butterflies from each other? 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of Teachable Machine, we set up a simple test. we
            uploaded 17 pictures each for three types of butterflies: the
            monarch, the sonoran, and the purple hairstreak. Then, we told
            Teachable Machine to train the model. It took a couple of seconds
            for it to train, but it worked! We now had a model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, it was time to test our model out. We had collected a bunch
            of sample images to try it out. We had one of each butterfly, then 
            a random butterfly image to see what would happen. The model worked
            well at identifying the first three images; the only problem was the 
            little hints of colors on the butterflies. But the random butterfly 
            was a mix of all three. It couldn't be classified due to its nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, I think the AI would be able to work better with more
            data. Mary and I wished we had more time to work on this. I think that
            AI has more practical uses as well, like for helping computers find specific
            organs in the body, or teaching emotions to people with neural problems. I hope
            that we can work more on this, and maybe this will spiral into a butterfly
            identifying application someday!

            it out: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/RkkefEiBC/

        <h2> &spades; Using Code in A Specific Department: How Does It Apply? &spades;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today at IT Girls, our supervisor Laurie Ferger gave us a
            challenge: we were going to hold a scavenger hunt across campus
            to see how different departments used technology. Me, Gia, and
            Kate went across campus, interviewing a bunch of different people.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src = "maya_dome.jfif" class="dome" alt = "One of the places we stopped was the dome.">
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the people we interviewed was iSchool Career Services worker
            Jeff Fouts. He was one of the last people we interviewed on our hunt,
            and he was quite friendly during the talk. His job? To help students
            find interships and careers around campus and the city. He gave us some
            insight into the iSchool scene. Did you know that there are more women at
            the iSchool, and that they make a greater salary at their jobs than men do?
        </p>
        <p>
            Fouts uses his online technology and data to help match students with
            an intership. The data also shows employers whether a student would meet
            the qualifications for the internship or not. Technology also helps the students
            get updated on the status of their intership, and if anything changes Throughout
            their intership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fouts has this advice to give to the IT Girls, as well as anyone who is 
            aspiring to go into the iSchool or computing in general: "Times are changing,
            it's a great time to enter the field. It's great to see how far ahead you
            girls are."
        </p>
        <p>Special thanks to Jeff Fouts for the interview.</p>

        <h2>&clubs; Why Citizen Science Matters &clubs;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 21st, 2021</p>
        <p>Today at IT Girls, we were talking about different websites
            that involve citizen science. What is citizen science, 
            exactly? It's the collection and analysis of data relating
            to the natural world by members of the general public, typically
            as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.
            Me and my partners Mary and Christian looked at the website
            Zooniverse for inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our presenatation was on one of the activities in Zooniverse. Some 
            students at King's College in London designed a citizen science project
            to try and identify patterns in breast cancer (specifically lymph nodes).
            Volutneers go through a tutorial and are taught to circle the centers and 
            barriers of these lymph nodes. The nodes are created using AI images. Over
            2,754 volunteers have participated in the project since it began in November
            of 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            How can citizen science be used in other fields? I think that this is a good
            resource for history, as they can use volunteers for scanning and translating
            old, lost documents. Citizen science is also great for keeping watch over
            endangered species. Another use for it is to look for patterns or irregularities
            in space. There is a lot of different practical uses. Basically, if there's a problem 
            of there not being enough of something or info about it, citizen science can help.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, citizen science is an important aspect of computer science, as well 
            as understanding our world. It can do a lot of help in the world if we keep implementing
            it in our society.

        <h2> &diams; Cybersecurity and How It Will Affect Our Future &diams;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 22nd, 2022</p>
        <h3>&hearts; Cybersecurity Definition &hearts;</h3>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is the measures taken to be protected against the criminal or unauthorized
            use of electronic data. it is also the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and 
            availabilty of information. Measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems
            and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside an organization. This is
            also called Information Technology (IT) security.
        </p>
        <h3>&diams; Types of Cybersecurity Attacks	&diams;</h3>
        <p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Phishing</dt>
                <dd>- a cybercrime in which targets are contacted by someone posing as a legitimate institution
                    to lure individuals into revealing their private information
                </dd>
                <dt>Insider Threats</dt>
                <dd>- a malicious threat to an organization that comes from people within it, who whave inside 
                    information concerning the organization's security practices, data, and computer systems
                </dd>
                <dt>Cookies</dt>
                <dd>- small text files sent by a website you're using, are bad or good depending on the website</dd>
                <dt>Data Leaks</dt>
                <dd>- adusting security controls on a device to not limit the amount of data collected by each app</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>
        <h3>&hearts; The Future of Cybersecurity &hearts;</h3>
        <p>
            I think that the future of cybersecurity is bright. However, we should still anticipate for the worst to
            happen. There will always be new threats emerging, as making more adaptive programs for these will have bugs
            at first. But I believe that technology will overcome and adapt to these problems. Hopefully the Internet will
            have a safe and sound future, due to the work of the next generation of cybersecurity engineers.

        <h2>&hearts; Bias or Bust &hearts;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 25th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            After our weekend off from IT Girls, we came back to discuss bias in the media, as well as in our own
            selves. We learned about all the different types of bias a person could have, and it surprised me how much
            unnoticed bias I had. We all have unnoticed bias in ourselves, and I think it's interesting how much
            we strive to not have bias, when we're hiding so much bias from ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            We played a game called Bias or Bust. It's quite simple: one team must defend a claim, while the other
            must debunk it. The teams then must find resources (or make their own in some cases) that support their 
            claim. They must present each claim to the person who is deciding on what claim they want, then try to debunk
            the other teams claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            This game was quite odd, mostly due to the sources we had to use. Yes, we had to use professional sources for 
            some of our claims. But convincing a six year old the Earth was flat? We had to make our own sources, since six
            year olds believe almost anything if it's said from someone they trust like their parents. Or, they learn from their
            idols, like Iron Man. As our clients got older, the more professional our calims had to sound. And as we let along, we
            saw the bias in our client grow and fester until she was a giant bigot.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, we can stop bias with our media. But so much bias is in our daily life, so it might be impossible.
            Bias isn't bad, but it's preventing us from all being closer to each other. If we understand the types of bias and 
            see it in our lives, we can all try and prevent it.

        <h2>&spades; What Makes A Chart Compelling? &spades;</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 26th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            What makes a chart compelling? Well first, you have to tell a story with the chart. Although it has to sell 
            your point, you still have to account for no bias. The chart shouldn't misinform its readers as well. Also,
            it must have context to tell the story. Let's talk about making a compelling chart while looking at this chart.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src = "media.png" class="chart" alt = "A chart about how much trust we put in the media.">
        </p>
        <h3>&hearts; The Story of This Graph &hearts;</h3>
        <p>This graph shows how much trust we put in the media on dire situations. Each shade of red represents a different
            crisis. The graph alternates from high to low, with an added constant of no answer. The studies show that most
            people would most likely put low trust into the media, with the other side with high trust in the media coming in second.
            Not a lot of people highly trust or distrust the media on topics, or have no answer to this situation.
        </p>
        <h3>&diams; Why It Works &diams;</h3>
        <p>
            This graph uses its stacked column format to show all the data, and using the different shades of red seperates
            each media subject. It also does't fall into bias, by showing a wide range of data for its subjects. Finally, the 
            data is labeled well and gets its point across clearly. The graph conveys how people trust the media during recent
            situations.

        <h2>Fighting Bias Like an IT Girl</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 28th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today at IT Girls, we had fun with AI generated content. On the left is my deep dream.After making our deep dreams online, 
            we discussed about bias in AI. Since our society is designed by standards, those AI are designed by those standards as well. 
            How does this affect our usage of the Internet, and how does it reflect on our society?
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src = "heisart.jpg" class="deepdream" alt = "The deep dream I made.">
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the activities the speaker had us do was look up images of women online. The results of the pictures of the women
            were quite normal. But the tags were quite shocking, as they only focused on women's bodies (pregnant, curvy, beautiful, etc.).
            We looked up pictures of men as a contrast, and they didn't have that problem. Why are we as a society so obsessed with
            women's bodies?
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example of what we did was go onto Dall-E mini. Dall-E mini is a website that draws examples of promts it is given. We
            looked up 'Darth Vader on vacation with his family' (yes, we were having fun). The results all showed Darth Vader with a basic 
            nuclear family. The family was also all white and straight. Dall-E notes that it has some form of societal bias, and is working
            on overcoming it in due time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overcoming bias is extremely important in advancing in AI technology. Altohugh we are aways off from a true idealistic AI,
            having diversity in the workforce can start a reaction to help include more diversity in AI. That way, AI can represent all 
            different backgrounds of life.
