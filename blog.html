        <h2>Butterflies and Machine Learning: How Do They Correlate?</h2>
        <p>Maya Aurand - July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Butterflies and machine learning. Can they coexist together?
            Actually, yes they can. Today, me and my partner Mary Rickman
            answered that question as we used the source Teachable Machine
            to answer one simple question: can an AI machine tell different types
            of butterflies from each other? 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of Teachable Machine, we set up a simple test. we
            uploaded 17 pictures each for three types of butterflies: the
            monarch, the sonoran, and the purple hairstreak. Then, we told
            Teachable Machine to train the model. It took a couple of seconds
            for it to train, but it worked! We now had a model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, it was time to test our model out. We had collected a bunch
            of sample images to try it out. We had one of each butterfly, then 
            a random butterfly image to see what would happen. The model worked
            well at identifying the first three images; the only problem was the 
            little hints of colors on the butterflies. But the random butterfly 
            was a mix of all three. It couldn't be classified due to its nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, I think the AI would be able to work better with more
            data. Mary and I wished we had more time to work on this. I think that
            AI has more practical uses as well, like for helping computers find specific
            organs in the body, or teaching emotions to people with neural problems. I hope
            that we can work more on this, and maybe this will spiral into a butterfly
            identifying application someday!
