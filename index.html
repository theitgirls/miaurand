            <h1>&clubs; Maya Aurand's Biography &clubs; </h1>
        <p>
        Maya Aurand is an aspiring young coder who lives in Arizona. She is interested in machine learning,
        AI, and software development. She has won a Regional Affiliate award for her outstanding work in code 
        for two years in a row. She is hoping to start her own computer club this year, as well as being able
        to teach more girls how to code. When she's not tirelessly working as the only girl in her computer
        science class, she's having fun doing musical theater, volunteer work, and her own personal projects.
        She hopes she has the pleasure of meeting people who are just as invested as her in something.

        <h2>&diams; A Personal Introduction from Maya Herself &diams;</h2>
        Hello, everyone! My name is Maya Aurand, and I am a rising junior at Lake Havasu High School 
        in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. I decided to take this class because I am one of few girls at 
        my school who have knowledge of code, and I am hoping to gain knowledge from this camp to 
        take back to teach girls how to code. I have interests in web design and in AI/machine learning. 
        My favorite shows at the moment are Futurama and Moon Knight, and my favorite game is Cookie Run: Kingdom. 
        Also, I am left handed and like the Maximum Ride book series.

            The video below is a tutorial for Gamemaker Studio 2. I think
            that making a game in this program is great for beginners (hey,
            it's how I started out). Make something amazing, I'm excited to 
            see what you make!
